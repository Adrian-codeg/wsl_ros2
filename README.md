This project is about building a robot that can explore a random map on its own. The robot’s job is to move around an unknown environment, understand its layout, and create a digital map of the area — all within 90 seconds.


Autonomous Movement:
The robot does not need help from humans. It uses sensors like cameras or laser scanners to find its way and avoid obstacles.

Map Creation:
While moving, the robot will draw a map. It will show where the walls, open spaces, and objects are.

Time Limit:
The robot must finish the map in 90 seconds. This means it must move quickly and plan its path smartly.

Send the Map Back:
When the time is up, the robot will send the map to a folder or directory, either using a wireless
